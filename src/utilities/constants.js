Roux and Jax quickly became the closest of brothers and share a special bond. Roux favorite things at home are booty rubs, bananas, long walks where he can stop and smell all the smells, swimming at the dog park and going on car rides. Roux is the sweetest boy and has brought infinite joy to our lives. He turned 10 in September but is still very much a puppy at heart.

    title:
      "The pet I'm interested in is at a shelter; what will it be like when I go to see her?",
    content: `Shelters come in all varieties. Some are modern and beautiful, while others are old-fashioned. Some are run by private charities (and usually have terms like “SPCA” or “Humane Society” in their names) and others are government facilities and may be what you'd call “no-frills.” 
    After you've selected a pet who seems right for you, most private shelters will let you visit with him or her in their own “dog apartments” or “kitty condos,” or will invite you to spend time with the pet in a special room or fenced outdoor area set aside for pets and adopters to get acquainted.
    If you are interested in a dog and already have a dog at home, many private shelters will require you to bring in your resident dog to meet the prospective new family member. This is to make sure there will be no future dog-to-dog conflicts.
    The best municipal agencies will be very like a private shelter. Others will simply give you access to their kennel areas and let you make your own choice. They may not have a special “get-acquainted” area, but you should be able to interact with the pet enough to know if you've met your match.

    title:
      'What kind of paperwork will I have to fill out at a private or municipal shelter?',
    content: `All private shelters will ask you to fill out an adoption application. Sometimes they do this before you've met any pets, and other times, they dontt have you do it until you've selected a pet you'd like to adopt.
    Sometimes, the questionnaire is mostly about practical things like your experience with pets, landlord information, and references. Other times, it's part of the process by which the shelter staff help steer you toward the pet who is right for your lifestyle.
    Municipal shelters sometimes have the same paperwork requirements as private shelters, but usually it's far more streamlined.

    title:
      "The pet I am interested in is with a rescue group, and I've emailed them about adopting him. What will happen next?",
    content: `Because most rescue groups are run by volunteers, it can take a little longer for them to get back to you about adoption than a “brick and mortar” shelter or animal control agency.
    Rescue groups' shelter pets are usually fostered by organization members. After inquiring, you'll often be invited to meet both the foster parent and shelter pet at a central adoption area, such as an event at a pet supply store.

  {
    title: 'What are the pros and cons of adopting from a rescue group?',
    content: `Rescue group adoptions tend to be much more personalized. The foster families know the pets very well - they should, since they live with them! - and they can give you a lot more information about how the pet fits into a family or home than shelters usually can.
    This personalization often makes the adoption process more rigorous, and it can take a lot longer. The rescue group may want to conduct a home visit before finalizing the adoption, and will probably contact your veterinarian and references, as well.

Was the pet with a rescue group that receives no outside funding, pays for all veterinary care, spay/neuter, training, housing, etc. out of their own pockets? Did the pet have extraordinary expenses, such as costly medical care, before being made available for adoption?",

    content: `Some shelters and rescue groups have free or discounted services, such as dog-training classes or veterinary or behavior assistance, to make sure your adoption goes smoothly after you get your new pet home.
    Rescue groups usually provide a lot of follow-up to adoptions, and some shelters do as well. If you're having health, behavior or adjustment problems with your new pet, call your adoption location and ask if they have any services that can help things work out!
