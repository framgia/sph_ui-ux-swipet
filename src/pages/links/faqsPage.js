            I’ve found a pet I’m interested in. Now what?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Congratulations! Your next step is to contact the organization
            listed on the pet’s page. Click “learn more about me” to go to
            Adopt-a-Pet.com for additional information on the shelter or rescue
            and its adoption process.

          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            What is the difference between a shelter and a rescue group?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            The biggest difference is that most shelters keep their available
            pets in a single facility, while most rescue groups keep theirs in
            the homes of volunteers.{" "}
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Also, shelters usually have paid staff as well as volunteers, while
            rescue groups are typically volunteer-run efforts.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            The pet I’m interested in is at a shelter; what will it be like when
            I go to see her?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Shelters come in all varieties. Some are modern and beautiful, while
            others are old-fashioned. Some are run by private charities (and
            usually have terms like “SPCA” or “Humane Society” in their names)
            and others are government facilities and may be what you’d call
            “no-frills.”
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            After you’ve selected a pet who seems right for you, most private
            shelters will let you visit with him or her in their own “dog
            apartments” or “kitty condos,” or will invite you to spend time with
            the pet in a special room or fenced outdoor area set aside for pets
            and adopters to get acquainted.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            If you are interested in a dog and already have a dog at home, many
            private shelters will require you to bring in your resident dog to
            meet the prospective new family member. This is to make sure there
            will be no future dog-to-dog conflicts.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            The best municipal agencies will be very like a private shelter.
            Others will simply give you access to their kennel areas and let you
            make your own choice. They may not have a special “get-acquainted”
            area, but you should be able to interact with the pet enough to know
            if you’ve met your match.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            What kind of paperwork will I have to fill out at a private or
            municipal shelter?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            All private shelters will ask you to fill out an adoption
            application.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Sometimes they do this before you’ve met any pets, and other times,
            they don’t have you do it until you’ve selected a pet you’d like to
            adopt. Sometimes, the questionnaire is mostly about practical things
            like your experience with pets, landlord information, and
            references. Other times, it’s part of the process by which the
            shelter staff help steer you toward the pet who is right for your
            lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Municipal shelters sometimes have the same paperwork requirements as
            private shelters, but usually it’s far more streamlined.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Should I choose a private or municipal shelter? Is one better than
            the other?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            However un-fancy the facility or minimal the staff, pets in animal
            control agencies and municipal shelters are just as wonderful as
            pets in other types of organizations. The adoption experience might
            be more pleasant at a private shelter, and the adoption fee is
            frequently much lower at a municipal shelter, but in the end, it’s
            about finding your special pet, wherever they are!
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            The pet I am interested in is with a rescue group, and I’ve emailed
            them about adopting him. What will happen next?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Because most rescue groups are run by volunteers, it can take a
            little longer for them to get back to you about adoption than a
            “brick and mortar” shelter or animal control agency.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Rescue groups’ shelter pets are usually fostered by organization
            members. After inquiring, you’ll often be invited to meet both the
            foster parent and shelter pet at a central adoption area, such as an
            event at a pet supply store.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            What are the pros and cons of adopting from a rescue group?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Rescue group adoptions tend to be much more personalized. The foster
            families know the pets very well – they should, since they live with
            them! – and they can give you a lot more information about how the
            pet fits into a family or home than shelters usually can.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            This personalization often makes the adoption process more rigorous,
            and it can take a lot longer. The rescue group may want to conduct a
            home visit before finalizing the adoption, and will probably contact
            your veterinarian and references, as well.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Will I be able to take my pet home immediately?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Usually, yes. Sometimes you’ll have to wait for the pet to be spayed
            or neutered.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            How much will it cost?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            While some pets are free, adoption fees commonly range between $25
            and $250. If you feel the cost is too high, ask what it’s based on.
            Was the pet with a rescue group that receives no outside funding,
            pays for all veterinary care, spay/neuter, training, housing, etc.
            out of their own pockets? Did the pet have extraordinary expenses,
            such as costly medical care, before being made available for
            adoption?
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            What happens if there are problems when I get my pet home?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Some shelters and rescue groups have free or discounted services,
            such as dog-training classes or veterinary or behavior assistance,
            to make sure your adoption goes smoothly after you get your new pet
            home.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            Rescue groups usually provide a lot of follow-up to adoptions, and
            some shelters do as well. If you’re having health, behavior or
            adjustment problems with your new pet, call your adoption location
            and ask if they have any services that can help things work out!
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-inter font-semibold text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            After my pet has settled in and we’re loving each other – what do I
            do next?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-4">
            someone else who has. So your next step is to tell the world about
            your wonderful pet, and where you found him or her!

          <p class="font-inter  font-normal text-base text-brown-900 px-7 mb-32">
